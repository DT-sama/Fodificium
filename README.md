# Fodificium: Minecraft in Better Latin

**NOTE:** while the translation is complete and playable, I don't consider it to be finished until a thorough quality check is done, so some translation choices might eventually change, and there might be some typos left. That being said, it *is* a definite improvement over the current Latin translation found in Minecraft, so please do give it a try! If you find any mistake, please contact me (tag: `dtsatori`) on Discord.

## Installation

To install, click “Code” then “Download ZIP”; extract the zip file, and copy the folder called `Fodificium` (**not** `Fodificium-main`) into your resource pack folder (on Windows, `%appdata%/.minecraft/resourcepacks` – or go to Options > Resource Packs > Open Pack Folder within Minecraft). Then activate the pack from the Options > Resource Packs menu, and change the language to “Sermo Latinus (Roma)” (it should be right below “Latina (Latium)”).
